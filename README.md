# CSC2001F Assignment 02

## Overview
This assignment aims to compare the operation of an AVL tree when dealing with the same dataset but randomized to different degrees.


a traditional array with a Binary Search Tree (BST) which were both implemented in Java. The dual implementation of these methods alongside each other allows for the comparison of their speed and efficiency when processing and searching through a dataset. Specifically, when dealing with a search function in which a date and list of countries is entered and the vaccinations numbers that correspond to the given date and countries is displayed.

## Makefile
The following commands can be used to run the code by using the Makefile.

- **make** - compile all relevant Java files for both the array and BST methods
- **make run X** - run the AVLExperiment function to randomized data to the degree of X 
                and execute an AVL insert and search algorithm
- **make clean** - delete all class files from the *bin* folder
